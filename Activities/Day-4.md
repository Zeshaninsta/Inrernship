# Day - 4 Presentaion Day
## This day is a presentation day, we have been preparing our selves for presentation after they told us that we should prepare our selves for presentation, actually it was on morning aroung 5:30, and the presentation starts at 8:00. each groups have 30 minute to present there report given to them, and we are 2nd group, so have beem audience for group while they are representing, after they finished therer presentation, we are the second group to present, so we did, 
### what i actually amazed from this day is that all of the students were presented there report using Amharic Language,and this was new for me as i was not exprieanced a presentation in Amharic language, so i terrified a little bit when am about to present, i was in the middle of thinking is this the right thing that i'm gonna do??? actually this is a big question i have been asking my self, but whatever i presented as i normally do, using English Language, when i start presenting i was so terrified and start forgeting what am about to present, and i do what i haven't done in my entire life, i start staring at my mobile screen and start reading what i wrote as a reporter, and students are staring at me, after all i finished my presentation, but im swallowed by sweat over my forehead. and then i relised, everybody can present by the language they prefer. and this actually a big lesson for me, i learned today, then i promissed my self next time this won't gonna happen.
