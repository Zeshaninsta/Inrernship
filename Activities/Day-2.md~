# This is Day 2 after i Joined Dan Energy Ethiopia for Internship, in this day
we have been waiting for there anouncement for what is coming next but nothing
comes out of them till it become 6 o'clock, when we reach six o'clock then
notified us to submit our assignment and they catagorized us in group to work
on the summary of what we are worked. as an oportunity i was in the first
group and we were 13 students but 1 of students was absent or no longer exits,
so we become 12 students. the country that was given to us is actually the
country which is found in centeral Africa, so there were 10 countries and also
10 focusing area, so we toast the focusing area so each of us will work on the
given area by reading or studying the individual report every one of us worked
and try to write the whole summary of it. so i got industrial Park Area to
work on. i used a chatbot to work on this summary and lastly i think i was
able to summarize and finish what was given to me.
